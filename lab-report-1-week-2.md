The objective here is to:
* Get familiar with VSCode and ssh
* Feel confident using the VSCode IDE


To this end we will:
1. Introduce ourselves to the group
2. Post a screenshot of our VSCode homepage to demonstrate that it is working
3. Access ieng6 remotely through ssh and post a screenshot


Before we get started, you will need to change your password for the student account related to this course in order to make to best use of your time. The system will take around 5-15 minutes to update your password, so it is good to do this as soon as possible. You can access your account by following the link below.

Once you update your password for this course, you can log onto UCSD's remote servers to access its files. We do this through a terminal command called ssh, but we will get to that later.

You must first install Visual Studio code to your computer:

There will be instructions on installation once you get to the VSCode download webpage.
